        <h1>Materials</h1>
        <p>We can't wait to dive into the world of watercolors with you. Just a quick heads-up: you'll need to bring
            your own materials to our course. But don't worry, below you’ll find a list of exactly what you’ll need.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>1. Watercolour Paper:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Make sure to grab watercolour paper with a thickness of 300g. We’ll be putting a lot of water and
                    paint down on the paper, which can be too much to handle for a thinner kind of paper.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Our recommendation is also to go for a cold-pressed, fine grain type paper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>2. Brushes:</h2>
                <p>You'll need a few brushes – one large round (16-24), one small round (4-6), and a mottler brush
                    (around 5cm wide).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We’d like to emphasise there’s no need to splurge on expensive brushes at this point. Affordable
                    hobby-level brushes, typically under 5 EUR each, are perfectly fine for learning.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>3. Watercolor Paints:</h2>
                <p>Watercolour paints come in two main forms: pans and tubes. We recommend using tubes for their
                    versatility.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>As a beginner, it's wise to resist the temptation to purchase an extensive range of colours. Instead,
                    we suggest starting with a basic set of colours to encourage colour mixing. Your initial colour
                    palette should include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red: Alizarin crimson</li>
                    <li>Yellow: New gamboge</li>
                    <li>Blue: Antwerp blue</li>
                    <li>Black: Payne's grey</li>
                    <li>Brown: Burnt umber</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>4. Masking Tape: </h2>
                <p>Grab regular masking tape from a hardware store. It's your secret weapon for creating clean edges, as
                    well as avoiding the paper buckling from the water.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope this information helps you prepare for our watercolour course. Don't hesitate to reach out if you
            have any questions or need further guidance.
        </p>
        <p>See you in class, ready to unleash your inner artist!</p>
