## Design

### Color Scheme


- Bright yellow was used as the main accent color of the website. Attention and creativity. 

- A mix of soft beige and clean white was used as background colors. Complements the strong accent color. Neutral. Colourful images not clashing with the background. Provides a strong contrast between both text and yelow accent elements such as buttons, and the background. 

- A dark brown was used for body text on the website, to give a slightly softer impression. 


### Typography


- Poppins Google Font was used as the main font throughout the website. This was chosen for high readbility of the content.


- Life Savers Google Font was used for the company logo. The intention of choosing Life Savers for this purpose was to attract users attention to the logo, and to communicate the creative nature of the company.
