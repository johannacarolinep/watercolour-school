## Design

### Color Scheme

![Colour scheme](documentation/colour-scheme.png)

- Bright yellow was used as the main accent color of the website. Attention and creativity. 

- A mix of soft beige and clean white was used as background colors. Complements the strong accent color. Neutral. Colourful images not clashing with the background. Provides a strong contrast between both text and yelow accent elements such as buttons, and the background. 

- A very dark brown was used for body text on the website, to give a slightly softer impression. 


### Typography
